This Hugo theme was forked from [yihui/hugo-ivy](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-ivy), which was ported from [Ivy](https://github.com/dmulholland/ivy), a minimalist website generator built in Python. I've added Disqus comment support which was already there but not enabled by default, show TOC by default option in post template, as well as a "Back to top" buttom on home and post content page.

I don't have time or the basic knowledge of Hugo themes to document it. You have to read the source code to understand what it can do. Like Ivy, this theme is also released under [the Unlicense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicense), which basically means you just do whatever you want.

Special thanks to:

- [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui): for the simple but elegant Hugo theme Hugo-ivy.
- [Vlad Feskov](https://github.com/vfeskov): for the [Vanilla Back To Top](https://github.com/vfeskov/vanilla-back-to-top) js script, which is so easy to use.
